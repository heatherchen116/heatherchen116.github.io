					<div class = 'title'>Supermarket Flowers</div>
					<div class = 'text'>
						I've been listening to "Supermarket Flowers" by Ed Sheeran literally nonstop today. Like the repeat setting where it loops through the same song over and over again. My favorite phrase from it is "A life with love is a life that's been lived". Recently I've definitely been feeling a lack of love in my life, from what I'm studying, from friends, and obviously from the lack of an SO. I think I've become pretty resilient to friends making fun of each other, especially because I'm bad at dealing with outwards emotions and feelings so I probably just naturally make friends who are the same way, but as a result there's not much "wholesome interaction", like telling your friends you care about them and performing acts of kindness, like general positive feedback, which I feel is necessary for feeling "happy", at least for me. At Cal, we put up a front of having our shit together or at least being able to handle the stress, and I feel like people aren't great at the whole *supporting you when you need them* kind of thing because everyone's just too busy worrying about their own stuff. <br> <br>
						Not really sure where I'm going with this but I guess I'm hoping in the upcoming weeks and months even, that my life is more full of love, in all aspects.

						Today I gave interview tips/advice to a girl who was prepping for a data science interview. I told her about my internship experience and questions I'd been asked on data science interviews. Although I haven't been doing data science for very long, it was nice to know that somehow it accumulated to something more substantial than I had expected and that I still had a fair amount of advice/experience/knowledge to share about the industry.

					<div class = 'text'>
						Especially in the last semester, I've noticed that people in my grade (3rd year) are getting busier with less time to have fun and even see each other. There might even be a standard to be super busy and be doing 1000 things, otherwise you're "not doing enough" or something. Today I spent 4 hours playing piano and went to dance office hours for 2 hours. Afterwards, I hung out with 3 freshmen friends from my team and spontaneously decided to get taco bell and play Anomia and take shots. It wrapped up at around 4am and we were all super tired, but it was ridiculously fun and I definitely missed doing that with friends :^).

						unfortunately, sunday is always a work day. and not a "let me learn about things that i'm interested in" kind of work day, it's more like a "i need to finish 2 problem sets in the next 2 days so try to figure these problems out as fast as possible" kind of work day. <br> <br>Whenever I feel this *lack of passion* for math and cs, I start to wonder whether I should switch and pursue my passions. The thing is, pursuing your passion seems risky when it's not a "high-paying career". Think of it this way, if you pursue your passion and find out you don't actually love it, you're now doing something that you don't love and you're not making money. However, if you pursue some sort of technical like CS for example, even if you don't love it, at the very least you're making good money. And that kind of situation is what we're stuck with, I guess.

						today my cousin steph was in town so I went hiking at Tilden with her. I'm so thankful I have cousins in the area, Steph and Tiff to see pretty frequently - they're pretty much the siblings I never had. <br> Then I grabbed dinner at Mount Everest with Allen and hung out for about 5 hours talking about anything and everything. We talked about the logical fallacy of starving African children, wanting to travel the world, the techie life of SF, the ideals of "wanting to make an impact", things being "all in your head" and all relative, movie tropes from 500 days of summer, changing perspectives on social media, group theory, having a narrator narrate your life, linguistics and word emphasis - literally everything. Recently I've been having a lot of deep/existential conversations with a couple of my friends, and every time after we talk I feel pretty drained and just ~weird~ from talking about all these existential things. But even so, I still really enjoy it and am glad I have people to have these conversations with, to essentially get all the weird thoughts floating in my head out. <br> Hanging out with Allen today also made me laugh more than I have in a while (laugh the hardest in a short amount of time) and .. yeah I guess that was pretty great ^_^

						let me preface this with the fact that I may be guilty of this too - BUT I just want to have a discussion about it... for awareness purposes. and to log this thought -->
						O K let me just go on a little rant about my temporal frustration for BEAUTIFUL, POLISHED INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS. I don't mean just general beautiful polished accounts, like if its beautiful from establishments/buildings/natural landscapes, I feel ok about that. But it's when people post pictures of themselves and like PICTURES OF THEIR DAILY LIVES but hella edited. This is my problem with it: <br> These are amplified pictures of everyday life, which makes it seem like YOUR everyday life should look like this too. But the truth is, NO ONE'S life looks like that. And by creating this false representation of life, it creates a sort of discomfort where you inherently formulate this standard from seeing that media and internalize it, even when it's entirely unrealistic.

					<div class = 'title'>Expressing Kindness</div>
					<div class = 'text'>
						From the past couple days I've gathered some insight on expressing kindness through little gestures that can make a huge difference.
						<ul style="list-style-type:circle" id = 'list'>
						<li> When asking to meet up with someone, especially on/near campus, saying "I'll come to you" rather than making the other person meet you wherever you are can be really considerate in showing that you're making time and going out of your way to see them, rather than just having them come to wherever is convenient for you. </li>
						<li> Initiating plans with people. Sometimes I refrain from asking people to hang out with the fear that they might say no or already have plans. Granted, it is a little vulnerable to ask someone to hang out with you. However, I think more often than not people actually appreciate getting asked to hang out, and I think from that small benefit, it's always worth asking.  </li>

						I'm starting to think there's such a thing as "city claustrophobia", which might actually be a pretty common thing, in which there's a certain stuffiness to the city, along with dirt, grime, noise, and just an abundance of people that really drains you. Today, Ellen and I drove out to Walnut Creek, and even just being on the highway, racing towards hills and valleys in the distance, was a reminder that there's so much more out there than just this shitty stressful life in Berkeley.

						There's a cool thing about having friends you've known since childhood - a special bond, where you know their parents and their families and you can always catch up right where you left off, even after not seeing them for months on end. It's pretty crazy to think that some college friends are people we've known for only a couple weeks or a couple months, and although we may feel close with them, there's an extra familiar feeling with long term friends that can only be built with time.

					<div class = 'title'>BART Wayfinding</div>
					<div class = 'text'>
						{Transportation} Wayfinding seems like such a trivial thing. It consists of simple things, just putting up signs in the station of where bathrooms, info desks, pay stations, escalators, etc are. It doesn't even require extra research since all of those are definitely included in the plans buried in some architect's office. But having a simple map, both inside the station and inside the train when arriving at each station can improve a commuter/visitor's experience by eliminating any possible confusions. The idea is that when on a train, you should know exactly what line you're on, what the next stop is, and when you arrive at the station, what station you're at and what direction you should exit to get to your destination in the most efficient way. And all of this can be possible with just some extra signage.

					<div class = 'text'>
						so i've come across this idea of guys being "players" quite often recently and it got me thinking about what this really says about a guy. people do it for girls too, shaming them for flirting with numerous guys, sometimes even concurrently. When I boil it down though, sometimes it's really hard to convince myself that these people are actually "playing" people in a malicious manner in order to just toy with their feelings and then leave. It might just be my faith in people's goodness, but I find it hard to believe that people will give up some vulnerability just to bring someone else down. So why does this happen? How do people develop a reputation for being "players"? Perhaps it's due to loneliness, lack of self control, and not actually being emotionally aware enough to figure out why/if you care about someone and what makes them special.

					<div class = 'title'>test prep</div>
					<div class = 'text'>
						for STEM classes at Cal, we can pretty much expect the midterm averages to be around 50% or something ridiculously low like that. As a result, I've gotten a little desensitized to low grades, which has both its positives and negatives. Compared to high school, I'm definitely less hung up on getting A's, but that's also the problem. Knowing that even a 60% might be decent excuses you  in a way from trying as hard as you possibly can. For my midterm today, I decided to turn that mentality around. Too many midterms have passed where I half-assed studying and ended up actually doing below average. In preparation for this midterm, I spent the past few days going through the textbook, taking notes, and going over homeworks and past midterms. I can't say for sure yet, but I think the hard work may have actually made an impact. ~ wauauau ~

						I want to take a quick moment to appreciate AFX for giving me something I never considered was possible. First of all, I didn't think I would ever look good dancing. I've always been uncomfortable with the way my body moves and with some extra practice recently, I think I'm getting better, little by little. Second, compassion. Compassion both for my teammates, who consistently show up on time, work hard to learn these pieces together, and cheer each other on even though we've only met once, and for the directors, who have so much talent and give so much time to choreograph, polish the piece, and hold office hours almost every day of the week to help us. <br> AFX is one of few clubs at Berkeley that doesn't relate to careers, getting jobs, getting connections, professional development, etc. Everyone is here only because they genuinely want to be, without any sort of unsaid competition, and for that attitude, I am grateful.

						dance here is so weird. it's like this fun extracurricular that everyone does and then some people end up being ridiculously good at it after 1-2 semesters. the thing with dance is that when it's done well, it looks effortless. not sure why this is different from anything else, but anyways - my point is that you never hear about people practicing dance for hours on end or even what they do during that practice. <br> friday night, from 12-4am, i came to realize that practicing dance was comparable to practicing piano - training muscle memory and listening to the music for little nuances that expand the piece beyond just notes. we picked apart every little detail in the first TWO MOVES for over an hour, including the angle of your shoulders, how wide apart your feet stand, how much you step out, how hard you hit the moves, the quality of the transitions between moves, and what beats the moves actually fall on. and this, this -- is what it takes to improve.

						the interesting thing about orchestra is that there’s this huge hour-long production with thousands of notes, but as someone in the audience i noticed that as soon as the moment passes, i forget how the previous melody sounded entirely. what i do remember, however, is that the last section was slower, more peaceful, and now there’s a sudden crash of drums and it’s louder than before
						<br>i dont remember anything

						Don’t take yourself so seriously. It’s freakin tiring to try to validate your identity everyday. Say, if you consider yourself to be “intelligent” or “smart”. The things you do day to day are dictated by these characteristics you’ve imposed on yourself. Let go of this weight on your shoulders.
						When doing anything, try putting 100% of your mind to it. Don’t let it drift away and think about 10 things at once. I read 50 pages of readings in 2 hours today.  </div>
