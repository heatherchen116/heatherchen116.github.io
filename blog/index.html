						so i've come across this idea of guys being "players" quite often recently and it got me thinking about what this really says about a guy. people do it for girls too, shaming them for flirting with numerous guys, sometimes even concurrently. When I boil it down though, sometimes it's really hard to convince myself that these people are actually "playing" people in a malicious manner in order to just toy with their feelings and then leave. It might just be my faith in people's goodness, but I find it hard to believe that people will give up some vulnerability just to bring someone else down. So why does this happen? How do people develop a reputation for being "players"? Perhaps it's due to loneliness, lack of self control, and not actually being emotionally aware enough to figure out why/if you care about someone and what makes them special.

						for STEM classes at Cal, we can pretty much expect the midterm averages to be around 50% or something ridiculously low like that. As a result, I've gotten a little desensitized to low grades, which has both its positives and negatives. Compared to high school, I'm definitely less hung up on getting A's, but that's also the problem. Knowing that even a 60% might be decent excuses you  in a way from trying as hard as you possibly can. For my midterm today, I decided to turn that mentality around. Too many midterms have passed where I half-assed studying and ended up actually doing below average. In preparation for this midterm, I spent the past few days going through the textbook, taking notes, and going over homeworks and past midterms. I can't say for sure yet, but I think the hard work may have actually made an impact. ~ wauauau ~

						I want to take a quick moment to appreciate AFX for giving me something I never considered was possible. First of all, I didn't think I would ever look good dancing. I've always been uncomfortable with the way my body moves and with some extra practice recently, I think I'm getting better, little by little. Second, compassion. Compassion both for my teammates, who consistently show up on time, work hard to learn these pieces together, and cheer each other on even though we've only met once, and for the directors, who have so much talent and give so much time to choreograph, polish the piece, and hold office hours almost every day of the week to help us. <br> AFX is one of few clubs at Berkeley that doesn't relate to careers, getting jobs, getting connections, professional development, etc. Everyone is here only because they genuinely want to be, without any sort of unsaid competition, and for that attitude, I am grateful.

						sunday was spent in my room. at home in maryland, I could spend days at home without going outside and feel content and comfortable. Here in Berkeley, staying at home for even over a couple hours drains the spirit of the adventurous soul. It must have something to do with how dark and small our apartment is -- no room to breathe.

						when the power went out, we walked outside to explore. it was still the same familiar street, the only difference being the absence of light illuminating the street. yet it felt like we had been transported into the wilderness. i was reminded of late nights admiring the stars, making smores, and walking with only a flashlight to guide you

						dance here is so weird. it's like this fun extracurricular that everyone does and then some people end up being ridiculously good at it after 1-2 semesters. the thing with dance is that when it's done well, it looks effortless. not sure why this is different from anything else, but anyways - my point is that you never hear about people practicing dance for hours on end or even what they do during that practice. <br> friday night, from 12-4am, i came to realize that practicing dance was comparable to practicing piano - training muscle memory and listening to the music for little nuances that expand the piece beyond just notes. we picked apart every little detail in the first TWO MOVES for over an hour, including the angle of your shoulders, how wide apart your feet stand, how much you step out, how hard you hit the moves, the quality of the transitions between moves, and what beats the moves actually fall on. and this, this -- is what it takes to improve.

						one interesting thing that a friend told me about research today is that research doesn't have to have a purpose. specifically, that you don't necessarily have to try to make x that will be used for y. you can just make x, just for the sake of making x. the premise is that research here is just to push the boundaries of what's possible, in hopes that one day it will indeed be used for something, or inspire someone with a new way to approach a problem.

						spending time alone in SF is one of my favorite things to do. the promise of adventure on the BART ride, the sunlight that streams in as you go up the escalator, out into the city, and the endless possibilities once you step out onto the main street. no one to dictate your schedule, your thoughts, or your path. <br> today, i spent three hours in Philz learning about quotient groups.

						this probably deserves to be mentioned right? Actually, fuck that. <br>
						today at dinner we talked about names and the connotations they had. Even though we didn't know people with these specific names, we all agreed that "Connor" was a tall attractive white boy who played lacross, and "Jane" was a nice smart girl who pulls off the mom style and is first chair cello, and that "Janet" was your CEO kinda girl. What makes names give off these vibes? Is it temporal based on current culture?

						the interesting thing about orchestra is that there’s this huge hour-long production with thousands of notes, but as someone in the audience i noticed that as soon as the moment passes, i forget how the previous melody sounded entirely. what i do remember, however, is that the last section was slower, more peaceful, and now there’s a sudden crash of drums and it’s louder than before

						Don’t take yourself so seriously. It’s freakin tiring to try to validate your identity everyday. Say, if you consider yourself to be “intelligent” or “smart”. The things you do day to day are dictated by these characteristics you’ve imposed on yourself. Let go of this weight on your shoulders.
						When doing anything, try putting 100% of your mind to it. Don’t let it drift away and think about 10 things at once. I read 50 pages of readings in 2 hours today.  </div>
