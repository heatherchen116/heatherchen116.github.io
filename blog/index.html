						i had this weird realization today that many of my close friends dont post on any social media regularly.. andrew, ellen, nolan, gloria, jun seo, sean, allen, nina .. (irene does tho! bless her) am i the only one who does? is this an anomaly? i really wished they posted more though because then i could get a glimpse of what they're up to. of course, i could just reach out and talk to them but to be honest not too much goes on in our daily lives so its unecessary (plus people are really busy) but just seeing what they post on their stories or twitter, just mundane snapshots of their day through their perspective, makes me feel closer to them especially when we're spread all over the world. even though i hate the toxic effects of social media in general, i think it's beneficial to see your friends posting stuff so it's a little easier to catch up when you see each other again. you kind of have a visual picture in your mind of what their lives have been like, which you can then fill in with their words as you catch up with them in person. also i realized i really don't like catching up that much - i like hanging out with people daily so i know the ins and outs of their lives and being more of a companion who shares inside jokes and "hey wanna do something im bored" rather than "hey let's get dinner and catch up on 5+ months that we haven't seen each other what is your life like now" granted i do like catching up with people i love but i think those more organic/casual interactions of studying together or playing board games or making dinner make me more emotional and "heart-happy" more than catching up dates. realistically though as i get older itll probably be more of the latter ..  </div>

					<div class = 'title'>new york, being alone</div>
					<div class = 'text'>
						i dont think going to domestic places alone bothers me at all anymore. taking a day trip to sf alone, finding a new cafe in oakland, taking a 2-day trip to new york city, doing things alone for the past few weeks has almost become norm. it is freeing though, to know i can just get up and go do things if i want to with no obligations. i almost think it's sometimes selfish to not invite someone along with me. what if they would have loved to come? but often times in my eyes it's too much effort to ask and figure out logistics, and not worth the rejection if they say no, so i end up just not inviting anyone. <br></br> i just got back from new york, where i checked out the world trade center (the view from the top is outstanding), saw Dear Evan Hansen (and bawled my eyes out), got drinks with calvin. the next day i went to the tenement museum (which is so underrated and amazing and has the most wonderful collection of city planning books), walked around k-town, and headed back on a vamoose bus at 6. vamoose is truly the way to go - going all the way to dc just to get on amtrak simply isn't practical.<br></br> calvin and i have been arguing about sf vs nyc for a couple days recently and because i was feeling extreme fomo from people starting work in sf, i was definitely feeling nostalgic and almost defensive about the city that i'll be starting my adult working life in. however, as soon as i stepped into the subway in new york, i remembered how captivating and heartwarming it is to be in new york city. it welcomes such a range of diverse backgrounds and industries, something san francisco will never achieve as long as money continues to be poured solely into tech. on bart, you can very clearly tell who's in tech and who's homeless. while i want to advocate for the fact that there are indeed people in san francisco who DO NOT WORK IN TECH, and we have to continue to acknowledge those heroes, i have more often than not, been disappointed to find out that indeed, this person i just met, does work at some huge tech company or startup just like everyone else. in new york, it's different. there are so many different versions and definitions of success. while finance is as large part of their economy, the many people you see on the subway could be actors, musicians, artists, fashion designers, tech people, and the list goes on and on. you simply cannot make an assumption. also i've noticed a lot more children/young people in new york city compared to SF, and it is incredibly heartwarming to see kids walking around, accompanied by their parents, teachers, or babysitters, or even alone. these kids display a sense of confidence and independence in this walkable city that i hope i can foster in my future child. as much as I love SF and its beautiful landscape, i know i definitely will move to new york sooner or later. the east coast is my true home. </div>

					<div class = 'title'>The Forgotten Towns of California</div>
					<div class = 'text'>
						Jun Seo introduced yet another captivating piece of media to me - <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17433294/salton-sea-crisis-drying-up-asthma-toxic-dust-pictures" >this</a> is one of the most moving and eye-opening articles i have read in the past few months:  This article uses storytelling and data so beautifully to portray the current living conditions of the Imperial Valley in California. For reference, that's near the border to Mexico just east of San Diego. I'm not going to summarize what's in the article but basically it made me realize that even though California is such an idealized place with palm trees and beautiful beaches and is the forefront of innovation, there is such a ridiculous income gap. Those people who are struggling to live in El Centro, who are born with asthma, who are stuck in hospitals day in and day out, simply because of the horrible air quality, aren't even able to leave the place because they don't have enough money to go anywhere else. Living in the major cities or suburbs of California is simply far too expensive. These places are forgotten when people all over the world speak about California and not enough attention is being brought to the poverty and environmental injustice that plagues this state. <br></br> I'm almost mad - no, I am mad - that UC Berkeley prioritizes computer science as a department SO MUCH, by constantly improving courses and hiring renowned faculty and having such enormous class sizes to accommodate the (self-perpetuating) demand, that we as students, when deciding what major to pursue, don't even consider other important fields of study such as biology, or environmental science, or public policy. Within student culture, non-engineering majors are "looked down upon" simply because the money in the Bay Area is prioritized in computer science, software, and the knowledge economy. If UC Berkeley had star professors and phenomenal courses in environmental science, maybe I would have felt like that was a viable path to go down, instead of convincing myself (along with many other students) that CS is not only profitable, but important. We're "building technology for social good, for the people, to increase communication" but when you look at the majority of startups and tech companies, they're just building technology to (mostly) serve the upper class, who already has access to smartphones, Macbooks, apple watches, and regular internet services. These people who live in the Imperial Valley, or the Central Valley, who are plagued with long commutes, health issues, poor living conditions, and NO WAY OUT, don't need to share pictures on Instagram of aesthetic latte art. They don't need Alexa-enabled devices to make their homes "smarter". They need a path of GETTING OUT OF THERE. While I do agree that data and technology are important for quantifying and raising awareness about these issues, the reality is, people are dying out there, and software, right now, is not going to save them. </div>

						haha the irony when you talk about investment and then you skip gym the next day.. to be fair im super sore so... jk that's just an excuse. <br></br> i never thought i'd be that person who reminisced about the "college days" but recently, the more i think about it, the more i miss some aspects of college. i realized that the classes i took in the last couple semesters helped to define me as a person, at least in those couple months. the readings, the lectures, and the assignments captured my mind and shaped my way of thinking and my conversations with others. i was flooded with new information in different formats and perspectives that in essence, made me a more interesting person. now that i'm not filling my days with hours of new information, i'm not really sure how to make myself "interesting" again. sure, i could watch a bunch of documentaries, but being in a class for a couple months vs. learning within a 2-hour video is just different. i'm craving that time investment, but i'm not really sure what to invest it in. </div>

						something i said in the last post was that good things take time. i realized through a recent conversation that i'm definitely more of an "instant gratification" type of person, which can be good and bad - i'm really bad at self-discipline but regret is something that almost never bothers me. anyWAYS the point is that im (really) trying to go to the gym/exercise regularly. today was my second day going to true body (for dat sweet 1 week free trial) which is actually good because it's forcing me to get the most value out of my one week. even though the classes weren't extremely hard, just going there and exercising to challenge and stretch the body is a good thing. <br></br> ok another thought i had today is that it's so interesting to me how you can find people with such specific common interests but still be completely platonic with them - i think i actually believe in platonic soulmates more than romantic soulmates </div>

						i finished at cal! im done! what a wild ride. i would probably have to put more thought into writing a legit reflection of it, but i think the things i got out of college are: reach out to friends, good things take time, and everyone's fighting their own battle. during the first couple weeks of my last semester, i was so ready to leave. i was *so* done with clubs, *so* done with the toxic culture, *so* annoyed by the rigid educational system. but then in the last week, i had to move out of my apartment, so i reached out to a couple friends to help me move. all of them volunteered their time and energy so generously and i spent an entire day with them, moving boxes out. what would've been a ridiculously stressful day turned out to be one of the most fun ones. that day, and a couple days after, i looked back and literally CRIED (on bart) thinking about how grateful i was to have the friends i have, and how lucky i was to have berkeley as a place to foster that community. even though the work in college is hard, it builds a community that can NEVER be replicated. when will you ever be able to walk home from the library with someone at 1am every day for a week straight, still see all the lights on at the libraries, and hear someone playing the donated piano in the moonlight? AND post about it on snapchat because everyone else will know exactly what you're talking about? college is honestly such a special place and even a couple weeks out, i know i'll miss it forever. </div>

						Unfortunately, the fun came to an end, and I've had a pretty awful transition coming back to school and reality. Hit by a lack of motivation and just a lack of hunger to learn, I've been trying to scrape by, completing my homework assignments barely on time and struggling to pay attention in class. <br> <br> 
						I think the problem is that I'm failing to see positive tangible feedback in what I'm doing, and as a result I just want to see the world, make art, make music, write, do *something* that validates my existence, I guess. Being just another fish in the ocean at UC Berkeley is starting to chip away at my self confidence and I'm not really sure how to get it back. I made fried rice the other day with Calvin and Nolan and omelet rice yesterday with Nolan which was pretty fun, though. I think I just need to do something that I'm proud of ..

						Right after getting back from Portland, I headed down to LA to get a bit of sunshine and warmth. I visited The Broad, a free modern art museum in LA, Grand Central Market, Santa Monica Pier, and Tongva Park on the first day. Tongva Park used to be a parking lot and was transformed into an urban park with a playground, restrooms, and a great view of the pier. On the second day, I went to Disneyland with Nolan and his brother and finally (FINALLY) got over my fear of roller coasters!!! I went on California Screamin' which even went upside down. I didn't expect it to be so much fun, and when it ended all too quickly, all I wanted to do was hop back on. All the other rides at Disneyland that we went on, including Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Radiator Springs, Goofy, and more were definitely not as exciting as California Screamin', but the production, lighting and set design for all the rides were amazing, and definitely worth the ticket price, not to mention the World of Color show at the very end.

						Spring break! Went to Portland with Nicole, Irene and Sean. At first I really didn't like Portland that all to be really honest. It was grey, really slow, and the downtown shopping area was a little underwhelming. However, after a couple days and spending time in the gardens, forests, and the newly gentrified areas, especially Pearl District, I grew to like it. I spent a day with Steph, got belgian waffles at the Waffle Window on Alberta Street, went to the Lan Su Garden, ate Japanese snacks at Behind the Museum Cafe and painted there. The belgian waffles we got included jalapeño cheddar bacon, and a strawberry nutella banana waffle, which were both phenomenal. Alberta Street was for the most part, pretty underwhelming, but one store that I fell in love with, Redbird Studios, had cards and notebooks all decorated with delicate watercolor sketches that were drawn by the woman at the store herself! For dinner, we had sushi at Bamboo, where we ordered a roll with sake poached pear (!!!!), coconut flan with grapefruit, and got ice cream at Wiz Bang Bar, which is owned by Salt and Straw. On the last day, we went to Multnomah Falls and hiked all the way to the top, and got Voodoo Donuts.

						ITS MIDTERM SEASON IDK WHAT HAPPENED DURING THIS WEEK <br>
						i spent a lot of time studying for 170 and some for math <br>
						some time playing piano :^) <br> 
						spent a day studying for environmental design <br> 
						went to a class at the gym <br><br>
						Even though studying is usually pretty painful, I feel like after spending so many hours of studying this week it actually didn't seem so bad anymore. I spent around 10 hours straight studying for environmental design and the hours kind of just flew by, talking about Fordism, stigmatized ghettos, definining urban environments, industrialism, etc and it was actually a lot of fun. This hasn't really happened to me for math yet, probably just because these subjects aren't really comparable, but as I studied each chapter of Environmental Design more and more, every piece started to come together in a timeline that really made sense, where one causes the next, and finally brings us to the present. OK that kind of just sounds like how history is but it makes it really interesting to study :)

						This past week I've had the UTMOST struggle with getting out of bed in the morning. I'm not sure if it's because my body is conditioned to sleep a full 8 hours now and I sleep really late, or that I'm just not hard enough on myself to force myself out of bed at 9am. Regardless, I made plans at 7am and usually when I make plans I try really hard not to flake, but I found myself checking my phone groggily at 11am, angry at myself for missing a morning alarm and flaking on plans once again. <br> <br> Tomorrow I'm going to morning yoga (I said it here!!) to try to fix this. I used to be pretty good about waking up in the morning, and always gave people shit for waking up in the PM, but now that it's happening to me, I have to do something about it.

						So somehow I got lucky and Nolan both likes playing piano AND has access to piano rooms, so I/we have been spending a lot of time there, which I've really appreciated because I otherwise don't have convenient access to a piano. Especially towards the end of high school and even more now in college, I've loved piano a more and more and am so grateful that I am able to play it and read music. In the past couple weeks, I've become really attached to music and spending 2-3 hours a week just playing random songs in the piano room is one of my favorite ways to destress and boost morale. Today I learned music in a different way than I ever have before - instead of reading sheet music, we found a youtube tutorial with an animated keyboard and I learned 'Supermarket Flowers' more by muscle memory than reading sheet music. Hopefully this means I'll be able to play it from memory soon.. ha

						Went to a Daya concert today even though I had a whole math pset to do. I listened to a good number of her songs, so I was excited when I saw tickets for sale. I feel like concerts make me appreciate music and artists a lot more just because in that moment, it's just this person on stage, sharing and performing what they've created. In a sense it's actually really vulnerable to put yourself out there and perform your own music, in the hopes that people will like it (and if you're on tour, chances are, people do). It's also that idea of when you meet a "celebrity" or a youtuber, someone you've followed online for a while, just to realize that they're also just normal people. <br><br>
						On a semi-unrelated note, I asked my friend Charles to go with me and even though I hadn't known him that well before, I had a really great time and definitely felt like I got to know him better. Turns out scrubs is also his favorite show, which is like.. SO rare because scrubs is weird AF but I love it hahaha.

					<div class = 'title'>Supermarket Flowers</div>
					<div class = 'text'>
						I've been listening to "Supermarket Flowers" by Ed Sheeran literally nonstop today. Like the repeat setting where it loops through the same song over and over again. My favorite phrase from it is <br> <center><i>"A life with love is a life that's been lived".</i></center> Recently I've definitely been feeling a lack of love in my life, from what I'm studying, from friends, and obviously from the lack of an SO. I think I've become pretty resilient to friends making fun of each other, especially because I'm bad at dealing with outwards emotions and feelings so I probably just naturally make friends who are the same way, but as a result there's not much "wholesome interaction", like telling your friends you care about them and performing acts of kindness, like general positive feedback, which I feel is necessary for feeling "happy", at least for me. At Cal, we put up a front of having our shit together or at least being able to handle the stress, and I feel like people aren't great at the whole *supporting you when you need them* kind of thing because everyone's just too busy worrying about their own stuff. <br> <br>
						Not really sure where I'm going with this but I guess I'm hoping in the upcoming weeks and months even, that my life is more full of love, in all aspects.

						Especially in the last semester, I've noticed that people in my grade (3rd year) are getting busier with less time to have fun and even see each other. There might even be a standard to be super busy and be doing 1000 things, otherwise you're "not doing enough" or something. Today I spent 4 hours playing piano and went to dance office hours for 2 hours. Afterwards, I hung out with 3 freshmen friends from my team and spontaneously decided to get taco bell and play Anomia and take shots. It wrapped up at around 4am and we were all super tired, but it was ridiculously fun and I definitely missed doing that with friends :^).

						unfortunately, sunday is always a work day. and not a "let me learn about things that i'm interested in" kind of work day, it's more like a "i need to finish 2 problem sets in the next 2 days so try to figure these problems out as fast as possible" kind of work day. <br> <br>Whenever I feel this *lack of passion* for math and cs, I start to wonder whether I should switch and pursue my passions. The thing is, pursuing your passion seems risky when it's not a "high-paying career". Think of it this way, if you pursue your passion and find out you don't actually love it, you're now doing something that you don't love and you're not making money. However, if you pursue some sort of technical like CS for example, even if you don't love it, at the very least you're making good money. And that kind of situation is what we're stuck with, I guess.

						today my cousin steph was in town so I went hiking at Tilden with her. I'm so thankful I have cousins in the area, Steph and Tiff to see pretty frequently - they're pretty much the siblings I never had. <br> Then I grabbed dinner at Mount Everest with Allen and hung out for about 5 hours talking about anything and everything. We talked about the logical fallacy of starving African children, wanting to travel the world, the techie life of SF, the ideals of "wanting to make an impact", things being "all in your head" and all relative, movie tropes from 500 days of summer, changing perspectives on social media, group theory, having a narrator narrate your life, linguistics and word emphasis - literally everything. Recently I've been having a lot of deep/existential conversations with a couple of my friends, and every time after we talk I feel pretty drained and just ~weird~ from talking about all these existential things. But even so, I still really enjoy it and am glad I have people to have these conversations with, to essentially get all the weird thoughts floating in my head out. <br> Hanging out with Allen today also made me laugh more than I have in a while (laugh the hardest in a short amount of time) and .. yeah I guess that was pretty great ^_^

						O K let me just go on a little rant about my temporal frustration for BEAUTIFUL, POLISHED INSTAGRAM ACCOUNTS. I don't mean just general beautiful polished accounts, like if its beautiful from establishments/buildings/natural landscapes, I feel ok about that. But it's when people post pictures of themselves and like PICTURES OF THEIR DAILY LIVES but hella edited. This is my problem with it: <br> These are amplified pictures of everyday life, which makes it seem like YOUR everyday life should look like this too. But the truth is, NO ONE'S life looks like that. And by creating this false representation of life, it creates a sort of discomfort where you inherently formulate this standard from seeing that media and internalize it, even when it's entirely unrealistic.

					<div class = 'title'>Expressing Kindness</div>
					<div class = 'text'>
						From the past couple days I've gathered some insight on expressing kindness through little gestures that can make a huge difference.
						<ul style="list-style-type:circle" id = 'list'>
						<li> When asking to meet up with someone, especially on/near campus, saying "I'll come to you" rather than making the other person meet you wherever you are can be really considerate in showing that you're making time and going out of your way to see them, rather than just having them come to wherever is convenient for you. </li>
						<li> Initiating plans with people. Sometimes I refrain from asking people to hang out with the fear that they might say no or already have plans. Granted, it is a little vulnerable to ask someone to hang out with you. However, I think more often than not people actually appreciate getting asked to hang out, and I think from that small benefit, it's always worth asking.  </li>

						I'm starting to think there's such a thing as "city claustrophobia", which might actually be a pretty common thing, in which there's a certain stuffiness to the city, along with dirt, grime, noise, and just an abundance of people that really drains you. Today, Ellen and I drove out to Walnut Creek, and even just being on the highway, racing towards hills and valleys in the distance, was a reminder that there's so much more out there than just this shitty stressful life in Berkeley.

						There's a cool thing about having friends you've known since childhood - a special bond, where you know their parents and their families and you can always catch up right where you left off, even after not seeing them for months on end. It's pretty crazy to think that some college friends are people we've known for only a couple weeks or a couple months, and although we may feel close with them, there's an extra familiar feeling with long term friends that can only be built with time.

					<div class = 'title'>BART Wayfinding</div>
					<div class = 'text'>
						{Transportation} Wayfinding seems like such a trivial thing. It consists of simple things, just putting up signs in the station of where bathrooms, info desks, pay stations, escalators, etc are. It doesn't even require extra research since all of those are definitely included in the plans buried in some architect's office. But having a simple map, both inside the station and inside the train when arriving at each station can improve a commuter/visitor's experience by eliminating any possible confusions. The idea is that when on a train, you should know exactly what line you're on, what the next stop is, and when you arrive at the station, what station you're at and what direction you should exit to get to your destination in the most efficient way. And all of this can be possible with just some extra signage.

						so i've come across this idea of guys being "players" quite often recently and it got me thinking about what this really says about a guy. people do it for girls too, shaming them for flirting with numerous guys, sometimes even concurrently. When I boil it down though, sometimes it's really hard to convince myself that these people are actually "playing" people in a malicious manner in order to just toy with their feelings and then leave. It might just be my faith in people's goodness, but I find it hard to believe that people will give up some vulnerability just to bring someone else down. So why does this happen? How do people develop a reputation for being "players"? Perhaps it's due to loneliness, lack of self control, and not actually being emotionally aware enough to figure out why/if you care about someone and what makes them special.

					<div class = 'text'>
						for STEM classes at Cal, we can pretty much expect the midterm averages to be around 50% or something ridiculously low like that. As a result, I've gotten a little desensitized to low grades, which has both its positives and negatives. Compared to high school, I'm definitely less hung up on getting A's, but that's also the problem. Knowing that even a 60% might be decent excuses you  in a way from trying as hard as you possibly can. For my midterm today, I decided to turn that mentality around. Too many midterms have passed where I half-assed studying and ended up actually doing below average. In preparation for this midterm, I spent the past few days going through the textbook, taking notes, and going over homeworks and past midterms. I can't say for sure yet, but I think the hard work may have actually made an impact. ~ wauauau ~

I've always been uncomfortable with the way my body moves and with some extra practice recently, I think I'm getting better, little by little. Second, compassion. Compassion both for my teammates, who consistently show up on time, work hard to learn these pieces together, and cheer each other on even though we've only met once, and for the directors, who have so much talent and give so much time to choreograph, polish the piece, and hold office hours almost every day of the week to help us. <br> AFX is one of few clubs at Berkeley that doesn't relate to careers, getting jobs, getting connections, professional development, etc. Everyone is here only because they genuinely want to be, without any sort of unsaid competition, and for that attitude, I am grateful.

						dance here is so weird. it's like this fun extracurricular that everyone does and then some people end up being ridiculously good at it after 1-2 semesters. the thing with dance is that when it's done well, it looks effortless. not sure why this is different from anything else, but anyways - my point is that you never hear about people practicing dance for hours on end or even what they do during that practice. <br> friday night, from 12-4am, i came to realize that practicing dance was comparable to practicing piano - training muscle memory and listening to the music for little nuances that expand the piece beyond just notes. we picked apart every little detail in the first TWO MOVES for over an hour, including the angle of your shoulders, how wide apart your feet stand, how much you step out, how hard you hit the moves, the quality of the transitions between moves, and what beats the moves actually fall on. and this, this -- is what it takes to improve.

						Don’t take yourself so seriously. It’s freakin tiring to try to validate your identity everyday. Say, if you consider yourself to be “intelligent” or “smart”. The things you do day to day are dictated by these characteristics you’ve imposed on yourself. Let go of this weight on your shoulders.
						When doing anything, try putting 100% of your mind to it. Don’t let it drift away and think about 10 things at once. I read 50 pages of readings in 2 hours today.  </div>
