						one interesting thing that a friend told me about research today is that research doesn't have to have a purpose. specifically, that you don't necessarily have to try to make x that will be used for y. you can just make x, just for the sake of making x. the premise is that research here is just to push the boundaries of what's possible, in hopes that one day it will indeed be used for something, or inspire someone with a new way to approach a problem.

					<div class = 'text'>
						spending time alone in SF is one of my favorite things to do. the promise of adventure on the BART ride, the sunlight that streams in as you go up the escalator, out into the city, and the endless possibilities once you step out onto the main street. no one to dictate your schedule, your thoughts, or your path. <br> today, i spent three hours in Philz learning about quotient groups.

						this probably deserves to be mentioned right? Actually, fuck that. <br>
						today at dinner we talked about names and the connotations they had. Even though we didn't know people with these specific names, we all agreed that "Connor" was a tall attractive white boy who played lacross, and "Jane" was a nice smart girl who pulls off the mom style and is first chair cello, and that "Janet" was your CEO kinda girl. What makes names give off these vibes? Is it temporal based on current culture?

					<div class = 'text'>
						every time i dance, im pushing my comfort zone. <br>
						i’ve almost dissected dance down to a science trying to figure out how to be better at it. let loose, be confident, hit the moves hard, smile, look cool, don’t smile all the time -- all in an effort not to embarrass myself. they always tell you to just have fun, but portraying the fact that you're having fun is another feat in itself.

						the interesting thing about orchestra is that there’s this huge hour-long production with thousands of notes, but as someone in the audience i noticed that as soon as the moment passes, i forget how the previous melody sounded entirely. what i do remember, however, is that the last section was slower, more peaceful, and now there’s a sudden crash of drums and it’s louder than before
						<br>i dont remember anything

						Don’t take yourself so seriously. It’s freakin tiring to try to validate your identity everyday. Say, if you consider yourself to be “intelligent” or “smart”. The things you do day to day are dictated by these characteristics you’ve imposed on yourself. Let go of this weight on your shoulders.
						When doing anything, try putting 100% of your mind to it. Don’t let it drift away and think about 10 things at once. I read 50 pages of readings in 2 hours today.  </div>
